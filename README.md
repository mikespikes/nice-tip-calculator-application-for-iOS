## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges while building the app was mainly installing xcode which constantly had to be re installed before working.
Another issue came through the simulator where it would sometimes stop working or take a long time to load before working.
My last challenge was that since bill amount was not used, I had to use let instead of vars as told in the directions in certains 
areas of creating the app.
